                                    <p><strong>How I got it:</strong> I reached out to Jane in early November when I was working on my thesis and brainstorming project ideas. During our conversation, I pitched my research interests and discovered they were exploring something similar! This is a perfect example of how cold emailing and clearly explaining your research interests can lead to amazing opportunities. 🚀</p>

I looked around for such organizations and found out there are many organizations, particularly in the Washington DC area, working with the Department of Education or other agencies to investigate student performance on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessments. The connection between assessment performance and data interpretation abilities made this opportunity perfect for my research interests!</p>

                                <p><strong>The beginning of my PhD journey!</strong> During my final year at Beloit College, I was fortunate enough to have both industry job offers and graduate school acceptances. I wanted to pursue a PhD regardless of what I was choosing. Being a first-generation college student in my family, education was always given preference.</p>
                                
                                <div class="expandable-content" style="display: none;">
                                    <p>So, I decided to go with PhD and chose WashU. I was always intrigued by the usage of visualizations in sports games (like cricket, badminton, football) growing up and also noticed how poorly designed visualizations were proliferating in news media and social media platforms. My dad would share them without knowing what the chart was saying or without noticing the irregularity. This pushed me to pursue PhD in visualization or human-computer interaction.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Finding My Mentor:</strong> <a href="https://alvitta.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Alvitta Ottley</a> was actively working on information visualization and how we can use them to communicate data to different stakeholders. When I was rotating with her, she gave me a project about creating a test to measure whether people can actually read or interpret data visualizations. This was right in my interest and league of why I started PhD!</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>The Mini-VLAT Project:</strong> I took the project without even giving it a second thought and not exactly knowing what it would entail. Little did I know it would involve everything from literature review to user studies to coming back and iterating on experimental issues to writing a paper and getting my first first-author best paper award at a premier visualization conference, EuroVIS! 🏆</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Germany & Conference Glory:</strong> Getting the opportunity to travel to Germany to present and being the first one to present in front of the whole conference audience (yes, best paper award gets to present in front of whole crowd instead of small session) was incredible. This was the beginning of my PhD journey.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>But it wasn't a straight path...</strong> Much like a complex data visualization with multiple axes and unexpected patterns, my PhD journey had its own twists, turns, and fascinating discoveries that I never anticipated. Like a scatter plot that reveals hidden correlations, each challenge revealed new insights about research, visualization, and myself. I will add more about my journey afterwards... 📊✨</p>
